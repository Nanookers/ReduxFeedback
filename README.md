## Description

Working with Redux really tested my ability to pay attention to details. While coding has been an adventure of teaching myself how to logically and orderly think through all the processes of how these systems and syntax work, Redux adds another layer of detail that is testing my abilities. 

The first challenge I had to overcome was understanding  the relationship between state and the reducer that I was building to carry state between  routes on a single page app. While frustrating at times, it was a good lesson in how you can develop  an array of information, or in this case an object. Prior to this project, state felt very stagnant, and located to a single instance. Now, I feel like I have TOTAL CONTROL OVER STATE!
...so long as I remain accountable for all instances of it. It is easy to get lost in the state-sauce. 

The second issue that I encountered, which ended up taking significantly longer to correct than I had expected, was getting the state to POST to the database. There were points when I went crosseyed, and realized that there are limits to my attention to detail when I am stuck in a code marathon. It reinforced the reality that I need to take better care of minding my own well-being. I hit points where I had spent more than an hour on one problem (like getting the state to turn up actual intergers instead of undefined values). My attention to detail went out the window, and I started googling the same  questions on repeat. The worst part about this was I consciously watched myself try the same solutions ad nauseam, and never stopped myself, and when I finally found the solution, I was so fatigued with solving the problem that I didn't bother to note how I did it. 

Overall, while admitedly it was a tiring experience, it was a good process to work through. I feel significantly more capable of working with redux, routes, and states. I had been hoping to spend more time working with material UI, but after this marathon, it's something that will have to wait for a later project.
